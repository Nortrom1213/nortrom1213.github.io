##### Abstract

Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) enables imaging with minimal radiation exposure but results in noisy outputs. Deep learning offers denoising solutions requiring large, multi-center datasets, but privacy and heterogeneity pose challenges. We propose **FedFDD**, a personalized federated learning approach that decomposes images via discrete cosine transform: high-frequency components are aggregated across clients while preserving local low-frequency structures. Evaluations on organ-specific LDCT datasets demonstrate that FedFDD outperforms state-of-the-art federated and centralized models, especially in non-IID scenarios and challenging denoising cases.
