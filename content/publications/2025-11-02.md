##### Abstract

In complex 3-D game environments, players rely on visual affordances to spot critical map transition points. Efficient identification of such points is vital for client-side auto-mapping and offers an objective basis for evaluating cue presentation. We formalize the task of detecting traversable **Spatial Transition Points** (STPs)—connectors between two sub-regions—and selecting the singular **Main STP** (MSTP) that lies on the designer-intended critical path, from a single frame. We introduce a two-stage deep-learning pipeline that first detects potential STPs using Faster R-CNN and then ranks them with a lightweight MSTP selector fusing local and global visual features. Both stages leverage parameter-efficient adapters, with an optional retrieval-augmented fusion step. Experiments on a custom dataset from five action-RPG titles reveal that full-network fine-tuning excels when data are ample, while adapter-only transfer proves more robust in low-data scenarios and for MSTP selection. By defining this novel problem, providing a baseline pipeline and dataset, and highlighting trade-offs in model adaptation, we aim to spur future AI-driven navigation aids and data-informed level-design tools.
