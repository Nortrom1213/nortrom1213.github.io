##### Abstract

Guard patrol behavior is central to the immersion and strategic depth of stealth games, while most existing systems rely on hand-crafted routes or specialized logic that struggle to balance coverage efficiency and responsive pursuit with believable naturalness. We propose a generic, fully explainable, training-free framework that integrates global knowledge and local information via Composite Potential Fields, combining three interpretable maps—Information, Confidence, and Connectivity—into a single kernel-filtered decision criterion. Our parametric, designer‐driven approach requires only a handful of decay and weight parameters—no retraining—to smoothly adapt across both occupancy‐grid and NavMesh‐partition abstractions. We evaluate on five representative game maps, two player-control policies, and five guard modes, confirming that our method outperforms classical baseline methods in both capture efficiency and patrol naturalness. Finally, we show how common stealth mechanics—distractions and environmental elements—integrate naturally into our framework as sub modules, enabling rapid prototyping of rich, dynamic, and responsive guard behaviors.
