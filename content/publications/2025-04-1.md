##### Abstract

Procedural Content Generation (PCG) has long enabled efficient and varied game level creation. However, integrating high-level design intentions and game mechanics into complex 3D environments remains challenging. This paper introduces a comprehensive framework that transforms narrative-level descriptions into playable 3D game levels. First, Large Language Models (LLMs) parse natural language descriptions into a structured **Game Level Description Language (GLDL)**, capturing essential spatial constraints. Next, we model level generation as a **Facility Layout Optimization** problem, ensuring that facility placements and configurations adhere to specified design criteria. Through comprehensive experiments—including automated constraint evaluations and agent-based simulations—our approach ensures both the feasibility and stability of constraints extracted from text. We confirm that the resulting levels remain interactive, reasonable, and controllable to their original specifications.
